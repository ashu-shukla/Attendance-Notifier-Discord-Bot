# Attendance-Notifier-Discord-Bot
Yo! I hope you get less stressed now! The only stress is audio routing and setup! Hopefully, this helps!


## Online Classes Made Hassle Free
### _Just set it and forget it_

Will take your speaker output as audio input and then using speech-recognition
it will list for a set of words given by you!

- Its simple.
- It's one-time setup
- It's Magicâœ¨

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**

This is how I used it with another bot, that would delete previous messages so that 
nobody gets confused with the previous class notifications.
